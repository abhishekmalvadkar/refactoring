- Always do frequent and small small commits because it has two advantages
- If your system crash, your code is already committed
- While refactoring legacy code if you done some mistake so you can easily revert that part only love 💕
- I have configured my Intelij as when I have created new method then it throws Unsupported operation exception with string like Not Implemented so I can know which is not implemented 👍
- I like to separate static variable with instance variable by separate line 👍
- Create constant for number using primitive , so we can get rid of boxing and unboxing kind of things because it's expensive and also get rid of object creation process because it's also expensive 💕
